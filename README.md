# Mad-Libs

a repository for a "Mad libs" style game.

The first menu contains 5 buttons: One for each 'story' and a random button.
When a button is pressed, the user is prompted a number of times to fill in the blanks of a story, with hints for the type of word (adjective, noun, verb, etc.)
Finally, a story is displayed, with the words inserted.

Pressing the 'back' button or the 'nice story!' button returns the user to the main menu instead of the prompts.
